    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I dont think my learning was limited from this lesson because whatever we talked about, I listened and understood the best I could and I tried answering as many questions as I could.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I don’t think I need to change much except always listening, even if I am distracted. I should just say, 'Talk to me later’, and start either working or listening.</td>
