    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td>I did however me and Matt spotted a mistake meaning we had finished the target however lots of zeros(in binary) kept appearing after the encryption.</td>

    <td>What I found effective was trial and improvement with the code with a bit of inspiration from our previous sheets to help me if I got REALLY stuck.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was me and Matt hung up on something we were trying to figure out, determined to solve. In hindsight, it took up around 40 mins and so we probably should have asked Mr Tansley for help.</td>
