(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

    <td>What I found effective was trial and improvement with the code with a bit of inspiration from our previous sheets to help me if I got REALLY stuck.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was me and Matt hung up on something we were trying to figure out, determined to solve. In hindsight, it took up around 40 mins and so we probably should have asked Mr Tansley for help.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
