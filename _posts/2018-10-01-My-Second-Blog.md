    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We had a working Caesar Cypher on Google sheets however this lesson, we had to 'neaten' up our code so  the user would just type something in and get a straight answer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To neaten up our Google Sheets and be able to translate te code into words.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I reached my target and started to translating both ways.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was dwelling on a problem which was not possible to solve and even after my classmates had advised me on how to do it I still tried to figure it out. And so I need to work on moving on swiftly so I can stay with tthe speed of the class.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time I will just accept that most of the time there is one way to do it which is easy and right and so I will stick with that one way.</td>
