  <tr>
    <th>Starting point:</th>
    <td>Rememberingwhat the coding for cyphering and decyphering was talking through it all since we missed a lesson due to Enrichment day.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Target for this lesson?</th>
    <td>To have copied out the alphabet 27 times into our sheets so we can have any shift number for cyphering.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td>I was halfway through my target and was going to finish the alphabets for homework.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Same as last week, listening and answering questions and think logically all helped me as I had forgotten most of all the coding so thinking through it sep by step really helped.

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was during the time we had to write out the alphabet I was talking too much and that is why I had to do it for homework.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I am just going to concentrate as hard as possible whilst doing the work in lesson.</td>
