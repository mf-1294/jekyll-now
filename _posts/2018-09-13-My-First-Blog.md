  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>We started by trying to figure out what 'GDKKN!' meant by using ‘computational thinking’, we soon figured out it meant ‘Hello’ and had been changed using a Caesar Cypher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To have figured out how to use Google Sheets as a Caesar Cypher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? 
(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>I did reach my target and could change a letter, I then attempted to change words.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The strategies which were affective during this lesson were listening to Mr Tansley and understanding what the function meant before just going off and copying it, this helped me try and start to figure out how to change a whole word.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was talking to my friends a bit too muc instead of listening to the teacher, I will try to focus on what I need to learn and save the talking for outside of class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will change my attitude and start working as soon as I need to and not stop concentrating until I leave the classroom and go off to the nest lesson.</td>
  </tr>
